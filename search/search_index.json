Here's an example demonstrating the refactoring of a class hierarchy to favor Composition over Inheritance:</p> <pre><code># Inheritance-based approach\nclass Animal:\n    def speak(self):\n        pass\n\nclass Dog(Animal):\n    def speak(self):\n        print(\"Woof!\")\n\nclass Cat(Animal):\n    def speak(self):\n        print(\"Meow!\")\n\n# Refactored Composition approach\nclass Animal:\n    def __init__(self, sound):\n        self.sound = sound\n\n    def speak(self):\n        print(self.sound)\n\ndog = Animal(\"Woof!\")\ncat = Animal(\"Meow!\")\n\ndog.speak()  # Output: Woof!\ncat.speak()  # Output: Meow!\n</code></pre> <p>In this refactored example, the hierarchy based on Inheritance is replaced with a more flexible Composition approach, where the <code>Animal</code> class is composed with the specific sound each animal makes. This allows for better maintainability and extensibility as new types of animals can be easily added without modifying the existing class structure.</p>"},{"location":"concurrency_and_parallelism/","title":"Concurrency and Parallelism","text":""},{"location":"concurrency_and_parallelism/#question","title":"Question","text":"<p>Main question: What is concurrency and parallelism in Python?</p> <p>Explanation: Concurrency is the ability of a program to execute multiple tasks simultaneously, while parallelism is the ability of a program to execute multiple tasks in parallel.
