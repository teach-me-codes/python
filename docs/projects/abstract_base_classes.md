# Abstract Base Classes

## Overview of Abstract Base Classes
Abstract Base Classes (ABCs) in Python serve as templates for other classes by defining a set of methods that subclasses must implement. They guide the structure of concrete implementations but are not intended to be instantiated themselves.

### Definition and Purpose
Abstract Base Classes offer a common interface for subclasses, ensuring that specific methods are present in all concrete implementations. They establish a contract that all subclasses must follow, fostering code reliability and maintainability.

### Advantages of Using Abstract Base Classes
- **Enforcement of Method Implementation**: ABCs guarantee that critical methods are implemented in all subclasses, reducing the risk of missing essential functionality.
- **Providing Guidelines for Subclasses**: By specifying required methods, ABCs give clear instructions to developers when creating new classes.
- **Promoting Code Reusability**: Through a shared interface provided by ABCs, developers can reuse code and design patterns across various classes.

## Why Use Abstract Base Classes

### Enforcing Structure and Method Implementation
Abstract Base Classes are valuable for enforcing a consistent structure across subclasses. By mandating the implementation of specific methods, they create a standardized interface, facilitating seamless interactions among different classes.

### Creating Hierarchies and Relationships
ABCs enable developers to establish hierarchies of related classes with shared methods through inheritance. By defining an ABC at the hierarchy's top, developers can build a cohesive set of classes that comply with common rules and behaviors.

In Python, Abstract Base Classes are implemented using the `abc` module. This module includes the `ABC` class for defining ABCs and the `abstractmethod` decorator to mark methods as abstract, signaling that they must be implemented by subclasses. Below is an example illustrating the creation and utilization of an abstract base class in Python:

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Shape(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def area(self):
        pass

class Square(Shape):
    def __init__(self, side):
        self.side = side

    def area(self):
        return self.side ** 2

# Instantiating the abstract class directly raises an error
# shape = Shape()  # This would raise a TypeError

# Creating an instance of the concrete class Square
square = Square(5)
print(square.area())  # Output: 25
```

By defining the `area` method in the `Shape` ABC, subclasses like `Square` must implement this method. This ensures that all shapes calculate their area consistently within the hierarchy.

Utilizing Abstract Base Classes is a powerful strategy in Python for organizing code, defining interfaces, and enhancing code reusability and consistency.

## 1. Defining Abstract Base Classes

Abstract Base Classes (ABCs) in Python are classes that define a set of methods that must be implemented by subclasses. They serve as a blueprint for other classes, providing a way to define interfaces and enforce method implementations in derived classes. ABCs cannot be instantiated themselves; instead, they are meant to be subclassed by concrete classes that provide implementations for the abstract methods defined in the ABC.

### 1.1 Syntax and Usage
To create an Abstract Base Class in Python, you need to make use of the `abc` module, which stands for Abstract Base Classes. The `abc` module provides the `ABC` and `abstractmethod` decorators for defining abstract methods within a class. 

Here is an example of defining an abstract base class using the `abc` module:
```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Shape(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def area(self):
        pass
    
    @abstractmethod
    def perimeter(self):
        pass
```

In the above example, the **Shape** class is an abstract base class with two abstract methods `area()` and `perimeter()` that need to be implemented by any subclass of **Shape**.

### 1.2 Using the `abc` Module
The `abc` module provides tools for working with abstract base classes. In addition to the `ABC` and `abstractmethod` decorators, it also includes utilities like `abstractproperty` and `abstractclassmethod` for defining abstract properties and class methods, respectively.

When a subclass of an ABC fails to implement one of the abstract methods defined in the base class, Python raises a `TypeError` at runtime. This mechanism ensures that all necessary methods are implemented in concrete subclasses, enforcing the intended behavior of the ABC.

## 2. Abstract Methods

### 2.1 Purpose and Implementation
Abstract methods are methods declared in an abstract base class but contain no implementation in the base class itself. Their purpose is to define a method signature that subclasses must implement. Abstract methods provide a way to specify what methods must be present in subclasses while delegating the actual implementation to concrete classes.

### 2.2 Decorator Usage for Abstract Methods
By using the `abstractmethod` decorator from the `abc` module, you can mark a method as abstract. This decorator ensures that any subclass inheriting from the abstract base class must provide an implementation for the abstract method; otherwise, it will result in an error.

An example illustrating the usage of the `abstractmethod` decorator for defining an abstract method:
```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Vehicle(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def start(self):
        pass
```

In the **Vehicle** abstract base class, the `start` method is declared as abstract. Any concrete class inheriting from **Vehicle** must implement the `start` method to avoid a `TypeError`.

## 3. Abstract Properties

### 3.1 Declaring Properties in Abstract Base Classes
Abstract properties in Python allow you to define properties in an abstract base class that must be implemented by subclasses. This ensures that specific attributes are present in subclasses while providing flexibility in the property's implementation.

### 3.2 Setter and Getter Methods
Abstract properties can also include setter and getter methods to control attribute access and modification in subclasses. By defining abstract properties with getter and setter methods, you can enforce certain behaviors and validations when working with attributes in subclasses.

By adhering to the structure and guidelines for abstract base classes, you can create a robust framework for inheritance and ensure consistent implementation across related classes in your Python projects.

## Implementing Concrete Classes from Abstract Base Classes

Abstract Base Classes (ABCs) in Python serve as a blueprint for defining a common interface that subclasses must adhere to by implementing specific methods. This section delves into the process of creating concrete classes by inheriting from ABCs.

### Inheriting from Abstract Base Classes

#### Extending Abstract Functionality
By inheriting from an ABC, a concrete class inherits the predefined functionality from the abstract methods of the base class. This enables the concrete class to leverage the shared interface stipulated by the ABC.

#### Implementing Abstract Methods
In order to instantiate a concrete class from an ABC, all abstract methods specified in the base class need to be implemented in the derived class. These abstract methods act as placeholders ensuring the requisite functionalities are present in the concrete class.

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Shape(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def area(self):
        pass

class Circle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, radius):
        self.radius = radius

    def area(self):
        return 3.14 * self.radius ** 2

circle = Circle(5)
print(circle.area())  # Output: 78.5
```

### Overriding Abstract Methods

#### Custom Implementations in Concrete Classes
Concrete classes have the flexibility to provide custom implementations for the abstract methods inherited from the ABC. This customization allows for tailored approaches in achieving the required functionalities within the derived class.

#### Integrating with Existing Code
Adhering to the ABC's interface empowers concrete classes to seamlessly integrate with pre-existing code that mandates specific methods. This facilitates code reusability and maintainability by ensuring compatibility across different classes.

### Abstract Properties in Concrete Classes

#### Accessing and Modifying Properties
Apart from abstract methods, ABCs can also define abstract properties that must be implemented in concrete classes. This mandates the presence of certain properties in derived classes, ensuring consistent access and modification.

#### Verification and Validation
Abstract properties play a crucial role in upholding data integrity and validation standards across interconnected classes. By enforcing the existence of specific properties, ABCs assist developers in creating robust and uniform implementations.

In conclusion, implementing concrete classes from Abstract Base Classes in Python establishes a standardized interface, fosters code coherence, and enforces method implementations in derived classes. These principles are pivotal in object-oriented programming to construct resilient class structures and uphold code dependability.

## 1. Working with Multiple Inheritance and Abstract Base Classes

Multiple inheritance in Python allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from more than one parent class. Abstract Base Classes (ABCs) in Python provide a way to define a set of methods that must be implemented by subclasses. This section explores how to effectively work with multiple inheritance and Abstract Base Classes.

### 1. Multiple Inheritance in Python
In Python, multiple inheritance refers to a class inheriting attributes and methods from more than one parent class. When a class is derived from more than one base class, it exhibits properties of all the base classes. 

#### 1.1 Defining Multiple Parent Classes
To create a class with multiple inheritance, you can define it as follows:

```python
class ParentClass1:
    # Parent Class 1 definition

class ParentClass2:
    # Parent Class 2 definition

class ChildClass(ParentClass1, ParentClass2):
    # Child class inheriting from ParentClass1 and ParentClass2
```

#### 1.2 Resolution Order and Method Lookup
Python follows the Method Resolution Order (MRO) to determine the order in which methods are inherited from parent classes. The MRO defines the sequence in which parent classes are searched for a method or attribute, ensuring a consistent and predictable method lookup order.

### 2. Mixin Classes
Mixin classes are a design pattern in Python where a class provides methods that can be easily added to other classes. Mixin classes do not stand alone but are used to add functionality to other classes without inheritance. 

#### 2.1 Role and Usage in Python
Mixin classes are typically used to add common functionality to different classes, promoting code reuse and aiding in organizing code by breaking functionalities into separate mixins.

#### 2.2 Mixing Abstract Base Classes with Concrete Classes
Abstract Base Classes can be used as mixins to enforce implementation of specific methods in concrete classes, helping define a clear interface for subclasses to implement.

### 3. Handling Diamond Problem
The diamond problem in multiple inheritance arises when a subclass inherits from two classes that have a common base class, leading to ambiguity in method resolution.

#### 3.1 Preventing Ambiguity in Method Resolution
Python addresses this ambiguity using the C3 linearization algorithm, ensuring a consistent and unambiguous order of method resolution.

#### 3.2 Order of Method Resolution
By following the C3 linearization method, Python resolves the diamond problem, ensuring a predictable order in which methods are inherited from parent classes.

Working with multiple inheritance and Abstract Base Classes in Python requires a clear understanding of method resolution order, the role of mixin classes, and techniques to prevent and resolve ambiguity in method resolution. Through proficient application of these concepts, robust and maintainable class hierarchies can be designed for Python projects.

# Abstract Base Classes: Registering Classes with Abstract Base Classes

## Registering Concrete Classes

Abstract Base Classes (ABCs) in Python allow for the creation of interfaces that mandate certain methods to be implemented by concrete subclasses. Registering concrete classes with ABCs formalizes these requirements and ensures implementation of necessary methods.

### Using `register()` Method

In Python's `abc` module, the `register()` method associates a specific class with an abstract base class. This action declares that the concrete class implements all the required methods specified by the ABC.

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class MyABC(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def my_method(self):
        pass

class MyClass:
    def my_method(self):
        print("Implementing my_method")

MyABC.register(MyClass)

# MyClass is now recognized as a subclass of MyABC
```

### Benefits of Registration

1. **Explicit Relationship**: Registering a class with an ABC clarifies the intention that the class fulfills the ABC's requirements.
   
2. **Runtime Identification**: Enables runtime identification of classes implementing specific interfaces defined by the ABC.

3. **Framework Flexibility**: Allows dynamic assignment of concrete classes to abstract interfaces, enhancing flexibility within frameworks.

## Checking Class Implementations

After registering classes with an ABC, verification is essential to ensure adherence to the defined interface. Python offers mechanisms to validate abstract method implementations in concrete classes.

### Verifying Abstract Method Implementations

Using the `@abstractmethod` decorator in the ABC ensures that any concrete class registered with that ABC must implement the specified abstract methods.

```python
class MyABC(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def my_method(self):
        pass

class MyClass:
    def my_method(self):
        print("Implementing my_method")

MyABC.register(MyClass)  # MyClass does not correctly implement my_method
```

### Runtime Validation

Python enables runtime validation to verify if a class correctly implements the required methods specified by the ABC. This validation confirms that the registered concrete classes meet the ABC's interface criteria during usage in the code.

By leveraging ABCs and class registration, Python promotes robustness and maintainability in codebases by enforcing adherence to defined interfaces and implementing runtime validation checks for class implementations.

# Abstract Properties and Decorators

## Property Decorators
In Python, **property decorators** provide a mechanism to manage attributes' access, modification, and deletion in classes. The primary property decorators include:
1. **@property**: Defines a method that can be accessed like an attribute.
2. **@<property_name>.setter**: Sets the value of the property.
3. **@<property_name>.deleter**: Deletes the property.

### Example of Property Decorators:
```python
class Circle:
    def __init__(self, radius):
        self._radius = radius
    
    @property
    def radius(self):
        return self._radius
    
    @radius.setter
    def radius(self, value):
        self._radius = value if value > 0 else 0
    
    @radius.deleter
    def radius(self):
        del self._radius

# Creating an instance of the Circle class
c = Circle(5)
print(c.radius)  # Output: 5

c.radius = -2  # Setting radius to a negative value (setter)
print(c.radius)  # Output: 0

del c.radius  # Deleting the radius attribute (deleter)
```

## Read-only Properties
Read-only properties in Python are values that cannot be modified after instantiation. They ensure certain attributes remain unchanged once set.

### Defining Properties as Read-only:
To create read-only properties, use the `@property` decorator without a setter. This setup enables property access without modification.

### Use Cases and Benefits:
1. **Data Protection**: Read-only properties maintain data integrity and prevent unauthorized modifications.
2. **Immutable Data**: By employing read-only properties, developers can establish immutable data structures, enhancing code predictability.
3. **Input Validation**: Read-only properties facilitate input validation, ensuring attribute values meet specified criteria.

Incorporating read-only properties enhances code robustness and manageability by imposing constraints on attribute modifications where required.

## Abstract Base Classes and Polymorphism

### Polymorphism in Python
Polymorphism is a key concept in object-oriented programming that allows different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. In Python, polymorphism enhances code reusability and readability by enabling the interchangeability of different classes based on a shared interface.

#### Definition and Benefits
**Polymorphism** in Python enables different objects to respond to the same method or operation uniquely. This flexibility allows for dynamic and versatile code where a method can be used across various classes, with behavior varying based on the object type. By utilizing polymorphism, developers can craft more generic and adaptable code that can adjust to different object types during runtime.

#### Implementing Polymorphic Behavior
To incorporate polymorphism in Python, classes can either inherit from a common base class or implement a shared interface. Subclasses have the flexibility to override methods inherited from the base class, providing their individualized implementation. This method permits different classes to share the same method name while defining specific behaviors based on their unique requirements.

### Using Abstract Base Classes for Polymorphism
Abstract Base Classes (ABCs) in Python serve as a mechanism for defining abstract methods that concrete subclasses must implement. ABCs function as interfaces that enforce a set of required methods for subclasses, maintaining a consistent API across various implementations.

#### Creating Interchangeable Components
Utilizing ABCs for polymorphism enables the creation of interchangeable components that adhere to a common interface specified by the abstract base class. This approach allows different classes to be used interchangeably when they share the same abstract methods, fostering code reuse and modularity.

#### Code Flexibility and Extensibility
Abstract Base Classes bolster code flexibility and extensibility by outlining a clear contract that dictates the essential methods for subclasses. This method empowers developers to construct applications with interchangeable components that can be effortlessly extended or modified without disrupting the existing codebase. Additionally, ABCs enhance code readability and maintainability by explicitly defining the expected behavior of subclasses.

By harnessing Abstract Base Classes for polymorphism, Python developers can construct robust and adaptable codebases that accommodate interchangeable components and dynamic behavior based on shared interfaces.
