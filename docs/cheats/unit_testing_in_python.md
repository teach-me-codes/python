| Running Unit Tests          | Execution of Test Suites, Test Discovery, Interpreting Test Results | Essential for debugging. |

## Test-Driven Development (TDD)

| Title                       | Concept                                                            | Codes                                           |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Overview of TDD              | Writing tests before writing the actual code to drive development. | Ensure code meets requirements. |
| TDD Workflow                | Red-Green-Refactor Cycle, Writing Tests First, Refactoring Code    | Improve code quality and design. |
| Applying TDD in Python Projects | Best Practices for TDD, Real-World Examples of TDD               | Enhance code flexibility and reliability. |

## Mocking and Stubbing

| Title                       | Concept                                                            | Codes                                           |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Mocking Objects             | Simulating objects or behaviors to test interactions with dependencies. | Isolate units for accurate testing. |
| Stubbing Functions          | Substituting specific functions to control behavior during testing. | Ensure unit test reliability. |
| Mocking Libraries in Python | Utilizing mocking libraries to streamline the process of mocking. | Choose appropriate mocking library. |
