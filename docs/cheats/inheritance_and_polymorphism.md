## Understanding Inheritance and Polymorphism

| Title                         | Concept                                                            | Code or Description                        |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Definition of Inheritance     | Creating new classes based on existing classes.                    | Facilitates code reuse and extension of functionality from base classes to derived classes. |
| Purpose of Inheritance        | Code Reusability, Extending Functionality, Promoting Modularity.   | Enables efficient use of existing code structures and establishment of class hierarchies. |
| Definition of Polymorphism    | Treating objects of different classes as objects of a common superclass. | Enhances code flexibility and simplifies code structure. |
| Significance of Polymorphism  | Promotes Code Reusability, Enhances Flexibility.                   | Allows for common interfaces, multiple implementations, and streamlined code maintenance. |

## Creating Inherited Classes

### Syntax for Inheriting Classes

| Title                           | Concept                                                        | Code                                             |
|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Extending Base Classes           | Inheriting properties and methods from a parent class.         | <pre lang="python">class BaseClass:<br>    # Base class definition<br>class SubClass(BaseClass):<br>    # Subclass inheriting from BaseClass</pre> |

### Types of Inheritance

| Title                           | Concept                                                        | Code                                             |
|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Single Inheritance               | Derived class inherits from a single base class.               | <pre lang="python">class SubClass(BaseClass):<br>    # Single inheritance</pre> |
| Multiple Inheritance             | Derived class inherits from multiple base classes.            | <pre lang="python">class SubClass(BaseClass1, BaseClass2):<br>    # Multiple inheritance</pre> |
| Multilevel Inheritance           | Successive inheritance levels from base to derived classes.    | <pre lang="python">class SubClass(DerivedClass):<br>    # Multilevel inheritance</pre> |
| Hierarchical Inheritance         | Multiple derived classes from a single base class.            | <pre lang="python">class SubClass1(BaseClass):<br>class SubClass2(BaseClass):<br>    # Hierarchical inheritance</pre> |

## Method Resolution Order (MRO) in Python

### Understanding MRO

1. Definition of MRO in Python:
    - Algorithm for determining the order of method resolution in inheritance.
2. Resolving Method Calls:
    - MRO resolves the order in which methods are accessed in class hierarchies.

### Calculating MRO

1. Applying C3 Linearization Algorithm:
    - Algorithm used in Python for determining the order of method resolution.
2. Determining Resolution Order:
    - Python calculates the MRO to resolve conflicts and determine method invocation.

## Polymorphism Concepts and Method Overriding

### Types of Polymorphism

1. Compile-Time Polymorphism:
    - Method Overloading where methods with the same name have different parameters.
2. Run-Time Polymorphism:
    - Method Overriding where a subclass provides a specific implementation for a method.

### Method Overloading

1. Understanding Method Overloading:
    - Defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameters.
2. Example of Method Overloading:
    - Demonstrating multiple methods with different parameters but the same name.

### Method Overriding

1. Explanation of Method Overriding:
    - Subclass provides a specific implementation of a method defined in the superclass.
2. Example of Method Overriding:
    - Customizing inherited methods in subclasses to suit specific requirements.

## Abstract Base Classes (ABCs)

### Introduction to ABCs

1. Definition and Purpose of ABCs:
    - Abstract classes with abstract methods to define a common interface.
2. Benefits of Using ABCs:
    - Ensures consistent method implementation in derived classes.

### Creating and Implementing ABCs

1. Syntax for Defining Abstract Methods:
    - Abstract methods within abstract classes using `@abstractmethod`.
2. Implementing ABCs in Concrete Classes:
    - Providing definitions for abstract methods in concrete subclasses.

## Method Overloading vs. Method Overriding

### Differences Between Overloading and Overriding

1. Conceptual Differences:
    - Overloading involves methods with the same name but different signatures, while overriding modifies inherited methods.
2. Use Cases for Each:
    - Overloading suits scenarios with varied method implementations, while overriding is useful for customizing inherited behavior.

### When to Use Overloading and Overriding

1. Scenarios for Overloading:
    - Situations requiring multiple method signatures for the same functionality.
2. Scenarios for Overriding:
    - Customizing inherited methods to meet specific subclass requirements effectively.

By mastering these concepts, Python developers can efficiently structure their code, make it more extensible, and enhance code reuse through inheritance and polymorphism.
