# Composition and Aggregation in Python

## Introduction to Composition and Aggregation

### Overview of Composition and Aggregation

| Title                       | Concept                                                            | Description                                    |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Definition and Importance   | **Composition:** A design pattern where a class contains objects of other classes.<br>**Aggregation:** A design pattern where a class has a reference to another class. | Promote code reuse, modularity, and establish relationships between classes through object containment. |
| Differences between Composition and Aggregation | Composition: Strong ownership relationship. Aggregation: Weaker relationship with shared ownership. | Determine the level of dependency and lifespan of the objects involved. |

## Composition in Python

### Understanding Composition

| Title                       | Concept                                                            | Description                                    |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Definition and Purpose of Composition | Define complex objects by combining simpler objects. | Create a "has-a" relationship between classes for building a more complex structure. |
| Relationship between Objects in Composition | **Whole-Part Relationship:** The whole is composed of parts. | Encapsulate objects for enhanced modularity and to represent complex systems. |

### Implementing Composition

| Title                       | Concept                                                            | Code                                           |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Syntax for Implementing Composition | Define classes and instantiate objects within a class. |<pre lang="python">class Engine:<br>    def __init__(self):<br>        pass<br>class Car:<br>    def __init__(self):<br>        self.engine = Engine()</pre>|
| Examples of Composition in Python Classes | **Example 1:** Car contains an Engine object.<br>**Example 2:** Human contains a Heart object. | Encapsulate functionality and data through object composition. |

### Advantages of Composition

| Title                       | Concept                                                            | Description                                    |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Code Reusability            | Create modular and reusable components. | Promotes cleaner code structure and reduces redundancy. |
| Flexibility in Design       | Allows for dynamic changes and scalability. | Enables easy modifications and adaptability in a system. |

## Aggregation in Python

### Understanding Aggregation

| Title                       | Concept                                                            | Description                                    |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Definition and Purpose of Aggregation | Represent a "has-a" relationship with shared ownership. | Utilize objects from other classes without strong ownership ties. |
| Difference between Aggregation and Composition | Aggregation: Weaker relationship, objects can exist independently.<br>Composition: Strong ownership, dependent objects are not independent. | Determine the nature of the relationship between classes based on object ownership.

### Implementing Aggregation

| Title                       | Concept                                                            | Code                                           |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Syntax for Implementing Aggregation | Referencing objects from another class without direct ownership. |<pre lang="python">class Department:<br>    def __init__(self):<br>        pass<br>class Company:<br>    def __init__(self, department):<br>        self.department = department</pre>|
| Examples of Aggregation in Python Classes | **Example 1:** Company references a Department object.<br>**Example 2:** University has Faculty objects. | Establish relationships between classes for broader system representation. |

### Advantages of Aggregation

| Title                       | Concept                                                            | Description                                    |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Loose Coupling              | Allows for flexible relationships between classes. | Reduces interdependencies and promotes modular design. |
| Enhanced Modularity         | Breaks down complex systems into smaller, manageable parts. | Improves maintainability and scalability of the codebase. |
