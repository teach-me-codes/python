# Data Handling and Processing Modules

## csv Module

The `csv` module in the Python Standard Library is designed for efficient handling of Comma-Separated Values (CSV) files commonly used for storing tabular data.

### 1. Reading and Writing CSV Files

Reading from a CSV file can be done using the `csv.reader()` function which returns an iterator to traverse through the rows.

```python
import csv

# Reading a CSV file
with open('data.csv') as file:
    csv_reader = csv.reader(file)
    for row in csv_reader:
        print(row)
```

For writing data to a CSV file, the `csv.writer()` function is utilized with the `writerow()` or `writerows()` methods.

```python
# Writing to a CSV file
data = [
    ['Name', 'Age'],
    ['Alice', 30],
    ['Bob', 25]
]

with open('output.csv', mode='w') as file:
    csv_writer = csv.writer(file)
    csv_writer.writerows(data)
```

### 2. CSV Data Manipulation

The `csv` module supports various data manipulation tasks like filtering rows, extracting columns, and transforming data within the CSV file. Advanced operations can be performed using list comprehensions or pandas library.

## json Module

Python's `json` module facilitates working with JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) data, a commonly used format for data exchange between systems.

### 1. JSON Data Serialization and Deserialization

Serialization is the conversion of Python objects to JSON strings using `json.dumps()`, while deserialization involves converting JSON strings back to Python objects using `json.loads()`.

```python
import json

# Serialization
data = {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30}
json_data = json.dumps(data)
print(json_data)

# Deserialization
python_data = json.loads(json_data)
print(python_data)
```

### 2. Handling JSON Data

The `json` module supports working with complex JSON structures, enabling efficient access and manipulation of nested objects and arrays.

## sqlite3 Module

The `sqlite3` module allows Python to interact with SQLite databases, a lightweight database engine suitable for small to medium-sized databases.

Establish a connection to an SQLite database using `sqlite3.connect()` and execute SQL queries with `execute()` method on the connection object.

```python
import sqlite3

# Database connection
conn = sqlite3.connect('example.db')
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Execute SQL query
cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM table")
rows = cursor.fetchall()
```

### 2. Executing SQL Queries

The `sqlite3` module supports executing various SQL queries like select, insert, update, and delete operations, making it easy to integrate database functionalities into Python applications for data management.
