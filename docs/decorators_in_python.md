## Introduction to Decorators

### What are Decorators?
Decorators in Python serve as a powerful feature enabling programmers to alter or extend the behavior of functions or methods without changing their core implementation. They essentially act as wrappers around existing functions, facilitating the dynamic addition of functionalities. Decorators find wide applications in Python programming for tasks such as logging, authentication, memoization, and more.

#### Definition and Purpose
Decorators aim to enhance the capabilities of pre-existing functions or methods while preserving their original logic intact. They offer a clean and effective approach to supplement functions with additional features, thus enhancing code modularity and reusability. Decorators are implemented by prefixing the function definition with the @ symbol followed by the decorator name.

#### Role in Python Programming
Decorators play a critical role in Python programming by fostering code flexibility and readability. By adhering to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle, decorators facilitate the separation of concerns and reduction of code redundancy. Essentially, decorators empower developers to inject cross-cutting concerns into functions seamlessly without altering the original code.

### Advantages of Using Decorators
The utilization of decorators in Python provides several advantages that bolster the overall robustness and scalability of codebases.

#### Code Reusability
Decorators significantly enhance code reusability by encapsulating common functionalities that can be applied across multiple functions or methods. Instead of duplicating code in various functions, decorators offer a centralized approach that can be effortlessly applied wherever required.

#### Separation of Concerns
An essential benefit of decorators is the clear separation of concerns they provide. By abstracting additional functionalities into decorators, the core functionality of functions remains focused on their primary tasks. This segregation promotes code maintainability, readability, and the ability to update or modify functionalities independently.

In conclusion, decorators in Python provide a versatile and efficient mechanism to enhance function behavior while maintaining a structured and modular codebase.

Through the adoption of decorators, developers can seamlessly integrate features like authentication, logging, caching, and more into their projects with minimal complexity, thereby improving overall functionality and code reusability.

# Creating and Using Decorators

Decorators in Python are a powerful mechanism that enables programmers to enhance the functionality of functions or methods without altering their original code. They facilitate code modularity, reusability, and brevity by allowing additional behavior to be seamlessly integrated into existing functions.

## Defining a Decorator Function

### Syntax and Structure
To create a decorator function, define a function that accepts another function as an argument. Typically, within the decorator function, a new function is defined to augment the behavior of the original function before or after its execution. The `@decorator_function` syntax is commonly employed to apply a decorator to a specific function.

Here's an illustrative example of a decorator function:
```python
def my_decorator(func):
    def wrapper():
        print("Before function is called")
        func()
        print("After function is called")
    return wrapper

@my_decorator
def greet():
    print("Hello!")

greet()
```

In this example, the `my_decorator` function is designed to prepend and append print statements before and after the `greet()` function's execution, respectively. Invoking `greet()` triggers the execution of `wrapper()`, which in turn orchestrates the original `greet()` function in conjunction with the supplementary functionality provided by the decorator.

### Implementing Decorators

#### Using the @ Symbol
Python facilitates the application of decorators to functions through the use of the `@` symbol placed above the function definition. This syntactic sugar streamlines the identification of the decorator utilized for a particular function.

#### Applying Multiple Decorators on a Single Function
It is feasible to employ multiple decorators on a single function by stacking them with the `@` syntax. When a function is adorned with multiple decorators, they are employed in a bottom-up fashion, implying that the decorator nearest to the function definition is executed first.

## Common Use Cases for Decorators

### Logging and Timing Functions
Decorators are frequently leveraged to log details related to function invocations, such as input parameters and output values. Moreover, they are valuable for timing functions to gauge their execution duration, which proves beneficial for performance optimization endeavors.

### Authorization and Access Control
Another prevalent application of decorators is enforcing authorization and access control policies. Decorators can validate user permissions or roles before permitting a function's execution, thereby fortifying the application's security perimeter.

By adeptly using decorators in Python, developers can significantly enhance their codebase's versatility and functionality. Proficiency in decorators empowers programmers to craft Python applications that are more adaptable, secure, and well-structured.

## Built-in Decorators in Python

### Introduction to Built-in Decorators
Decorators in Python are essential tools that allow modifications or extensions to the functionality of functions or methods without changing their core implementation. Python offers a variety of built-in decorators that provide additional features and flexibility to the code. Among the crucial built-in decorators in Python are `@property`, `@staticmethod`, and `@classmethod`, which play a significant role in developing efficient and well-organized Python code.

#### Overview of @property, @staticmethod, @classmethod
- **@property Decorator**: Defines properties in a class and manages attribute access.
- **@staticmethod Decorator**: Introduces a static method within a class independent of class instances.
- **@classmethod Decorator**: Establishes class methods that interact with the class rather than instances of the class.

#### Understanding their Applications
Each of these built-in decorators serves specific purposes and brings advantages when utilized in Python programming. Developers can improve code readability, maintainability, and functionality by making use of these decorators.

### @property Decorator

The `@property` decorator simplifies the creation of properties in a class, automatically triggering getter, setter, and deleter methods for attribute access. This decorator streamlines attribute handling and enhances code clarity.

#### Definition and Usage
```python
class Circle:
    def __init__(self, radius):
        self._radius = radius

    @property
    def radius(self):
        return self._radius

    @radius.setter
    def radius(self, value):
        self._radius = value

    @radius.deleter
    def radius(self):
        del self._radius
```

#### Getter, Setter, Deleter Methods
- **Getter Method**: Provides attribute value access.
- **Setter Method**: Assigns values to the attribute.
- **Deleter Method**: Deletes the attribute.

### @staticmethod Decorator

The `@staticmethod` decorator defines a static method within a class that does not rely on the class instance. Static methods are independent of both class and instance variables.

#### Definition and Usage
```python
class MathOperations:
    @staticmethod
    def add_numbers(x, y):
        return x + y
```

#### Static Methods vs. Instance Methods
- **Static Methods**: Operate without access to class or instance variables.
- **Instance Methods**: Interact with the class instance using the `self` parameter.

### @classmethod Decorator

The `@classmethod` decorator establishes a class method that operates on the class itself rather than instances of the class. Class methods can access and modify class-specific attributes.

#### Definition and Usage
```python
class MathOperations:
    @classmethod
    def multiply_numbers(cls, x, y):
        return x * y
```

#### Class Methods and Instance Methods
- Class methods interact with the class and have access to class variables.
- Instance methods work with class instances and access instance-specific data.

By mastering the use of these built-in decorators in Python, developers can significantly enhance the functionality and structure of their code.
## Custom Decorators

Decorators in Python are a powerful tool for modifying or extending the behavior of functions or methods. Custom decorators allow developers to encapsulate common functionality that can be applied to multiple functions without repeating code. In this section, we will delve into implementing custom decorators, chaining them, and explore practical examples of their applications.

### 1. Implementing Custom Decorators

Custom decorators in Python are implemented using higher-order functions that take a function as an argument and return a new function. This new function typically adds functionality before or after the original function is called.

#### 1.1 Writing Custom Decorator Functions

To create a custom decorator, you define a function that takes another function as input, performs some additional processing, and returns a new function that may invoke the original function. Here's a basic example of a custom decorator that logs the function name before calling it:

```python
def log_function(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        print(f"Calling function: {func.__name__}")
        return func(*args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper

@log_function
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

greet("Alice")
```

#### 1.2 Decorators with Arguments

Custom decorators can also accept arguments by adding an additional layer of function nesting. This allows decorators to be more **flexible** and **configurable** based on the arguments provided. Here's an example of a decorator with arguments that repeats a function call a certain number of times:

```python
def repeat(num_times):
    def decorator_repeat(func):
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            for _ in range(num_times):
                func(*args, **kwargs)
        return wrapper
    return decorator_repeat

@repeat(3)
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

greet("Bob")
```

### 2. Chaining Decorators

Chaining decorators involves applying multiple decorators to a single function. The order in which decorators are applied can affect the behavior of the function.

#### 2.1 Using Multiple Custom Decorators

When chaining decorators, the order in which they are stacked using the `@decorator1` and `@decorator2` syntax matters. Decorators are applied from the **bottom up**, with the last decorator defined being the **outermost**.

#### 2.2 Order of Execution in Decorator Chaining

In decorator chaining, the **outermost decorator is executed first**, followed by the next inner decorator until the original function is reached. Understanding the order of execution is crucial when designing complex decorator chains to ensure the desired behavior.

### 3. Practical Examples of Custom Decorators

Custom decorators find practical applications in scenarios like error handling and performance optimization.

#### 3.1 Error Handling Decorators

Error handling decorators can be used to handle exceptions and gracefully manage errors within functions, providing a clean and centralized way to deal with unexpected behavior.

#### 3.2 Performance Optimization Decorators

Performance optimization decorators allow developers to monitor and enhance the performance of functions by measuring execution time, caching results, or applying optimizations to critical code segments.

By mastering **custom decorators** in Python, developers can enhance code **modularity**, **reusability**, and **maintainability** while simplifying complex functionalities through a seamless and elegant approach.
## Decorators with Parameters

Decorators in Python are a powerful tool that allows you to modify the behavior of functions or methods. Adding parameters to decorators further enhances their flexibility and functionality. This section will explore how parameters can be integrated into decorators, along with examples showcasing their usage.

### 1. Passing Parameters to Decorators

#### 1.1 Adding Arguments to Decorator Functions
When incorporating parameters into decorators, it is essential to understand how to pass arguments to the decorator functions. By including arguments in the decorator definition, you can customize the behavior of the decorator based on these inputs. 

Here is an example of defining a decorator function that takes parameters:
```python
def repeat(num_times):
    def decorator_repeat(func):
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            for _ in range(num_times):
                result = func(*args, **kwargs)
            return result
        return wrapper
    return decorator_repeat

@repeat(num_times=3)
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}")

greet("Alice")
```
In this example, the **repeat** decorator takes the **num_times** parameter to specify how many times the decorated function should be executed.

#### 1.2 Using Parameters in Decorator Logic
Parameters in decorators can be utilized to introduce conditions or logic based on the provided arguments. By incorporating parameters in the decorator logic, you can dynamically adjust the behavior of the decorated function.

### 2. Decorators with Variable Number of Arguments

#### 2.1 Handling *args and **kwargs
To create decorators that can handle a variable number of arguments, Python provides **\*args** and **\*\*kwargs** parameters. These special parameters allow decorators to accept an arbitrary number of positional arguments and keyword arguments, respectively. Utilizing **\*args** and **\*\*kwargs** offers flexibility in defining decorators that can work with diverse function signatures.

#### 2.2 Dynamic Parameter Handling in Decorators
Dynamic parameter handling in decorators enables the creation of robust and adaptable decorators that can cater to different function requirements. By leveraging the flexibility of Python's argument unpacking, decorators can be designed to be more versatile and accommodating varying input scenarios.

### 3. Examples of Decorators with Parameters

#### 3.1 Parameterized Timer Decorator
A common example of decorators with parameters is a parameterized timer decorator that measures the execution time of a function based on the specified number of repetitions.

#### 3.2 Conditional Decorators based on Parameters
Another useful application of decorators with parameters is to create conditional decorators that execute based on certain criteria provided as arguments.

Incorporating parameters into decorators adds a layer of customization and versatility, allowing developers to tailor the behavior and functionality of decorators to suit specific use cases. By leveraging parameters effectively, decorators can be made more adaptable and powerful in enhancing the capabilities of functions and methods.
# Decorator Use Cases and Best Practices

## Common Use Cases for Decorators

Decorators in Python serve as a versatile tool enhancing function functionality and reliability across various applications. Two common use cases for decorators are:

### 1. Caching Function Results

Decorators offer a seamless way to implement caching mechanisms, improving the performance of functions with intensive computations or I/O operations. By storing and reusing the results of function calls, decorators reduce redundant calculations and enhance efficiency, especially when the same arguments are utilized repeatedly.

Below is a straightforward example of a caching decorator using a dictionary for result storage:
```python
import functools

def cache_decorator(func):
    cache = {}

    @functools.wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args):
        if args in cache:
            return cache[args]
        result = func(*args)
        cache[args] = result
        return result

    return wrapper

@cache_decorator
def fibonacci(n):
    if n < 2:
        return n
    return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

fibonacci(10)  # Result will be cached for subsequent calls
```

### 2. Input Validation and Sanitization

Decorators can enforce input validation and sanitization for functions, ensuring that input parameters meet specific criteria before executing the primary function logic. This facilitates data integrity and prevents errors caused by invalid inputs.

Here is an example of an input validation decorator:
```python
def validate_input(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        # Input parameter validation
        if all(isinstance(arg, int) for arg in args):
            return func(*args, **kwargs)
        else:
            raise ValueError("Input parameters must be integers.")
    return wrapper

@validate_input
def multiply_numbers(a, b):
    return a * b

multiply_numbers(3, 4)  # Valid input, returns 12
multiply_numbers('3', 4)  # Invalid input, raises ValueError

## Best Practices when Using Decorators

When integrating decorators into code, following best practices ensures maintainability and readability:

### 1. Keeping Decorator Logic Simple

Simplicity in decorator logic enhances code clarity and understandability. Complex decorator logic can hinder code debugging and troubleshooting.

### 2. Documenting Decorator Functions

Documenting decorator functions is crucial for future reference and collaboration. Clear documentation helps other developers comprehend the purpose and usage of decorators within the codebase.

## Performance Considerations with Decorators

While decorators provide flexibility, performance impacts should be considered:

### 1. Impact on Code Execution Time

Additional abstraction introduced by decorators may impact code performance. Monitoring execution time of decorated functions is crucial, particularly in performance-sensitive scenarios.

### 2. Avoiding Overuse of Decorators

Excessive decorator usage can introduce unnecessary complexity and reduce code readability. Decorators should be applied judiciously when enhancing code organization and functionality yield clear benefits.

Understanding these common use cases, adhering to best practices, and considering performance implications enable efficient and maintainable code leveraging decorators in Python.

# Answer
# What is a Decorator in Python?

In Python, a **decorator** is a design pattern that allows you to dynamically alter the functionality of a function, method, or class without changing its existing structure. Decorators are implemented using the `@decorator_function` syntax in Python.

Decorators are particularly useful for adding extra functionality such as logging, input validation, caching, or altering the behavior of functions/methods in a modular and reusable way.

## How are Decorators implemented in Python?

Decorators in Python are typically implemented as functions that take another function as an argument, add some functionality to it, and then return a new function. This concept is also known as **higher-order functions**.

Here is an example of a decorator function in Python:

```python
def my_decorator(func):
    def wrapper():
        print("Something is happening before the function is called.")
        func()
        print("Something is happening after the function is called.")
    return wrapper

@my_decorator
def say_hello():
    print("Hello!")

say_hello()
```

In the example above, `my_decorator` is a decorator function that prints messages before and after the `say_hello` function is called.

## Can you provide an example of using a Decorator to add additional functionality to a function?

Sure! Here is an example of using a decorator to time how long a function takes to execute:

```python
import time

def timer(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        end_time = time.time()
        print(f"Execution time: {end_time - start_time} seconds")
        return result
    return wrapper

@timer
def calculate_sum(n):
    return sum(range(n+1))

result = calculate_sum(1000000)
print(result)
```

In this example, the `timer` decorator calculates the time taken to execute the `calculate_sum` function, prints the execution time, and returns the result of the function.

## What are the advantages of using Decorators in Python programming?

Some advantages of using decorators in Python programming include:

- **Modularity**: Decorators allow you to separate concerns and keep the core functionality of functions/methods clean.
- **Code Reusability**: Decorators enable you to apply the same functionality to multiple functions without duplicating code.
- **Improved Readability**: By using decorators, you can add or modify behavior in a clear and concise manner, enhancing the readability of your code.
- **Easy Maintenance**: Decorators make it easy to update or remove functionality from functions/methods without making significant changes to the original code.
- **Encourages DRY Principle**: Decorators promote the "Don't Repeat Yourself" principle by abstracting common functionalities into reusable decorators.

# Question
**Main question**: How do Decorators work in Python?

**Explanation**: Describe the mechanism by which Decorators wrap a function and modify its behavior without changing its source code.

**Follow-up questions**:

1. What are some common use cases for applying Decorators in Python?

2. Can Decorators be nested in Python to apply multiple layers of modification to a function?

3. How do Decorators enhance code reusability and maintainability in Python applications?





# Answer
### How do Decorators work in Python?

Decorators in Python are functions that modify the functionality of another function or method. They allow you to wrap a function, modify its behavior, and return a new function without changing the source code of the original function. 

Here is a simple example to illustrate how decorators work:

```python
def decorator_function(func):
    def wrapper():
        print("Before calling the function")
        func()
        print("After calling the function")
    return wrapper

@decorator_function
def my_function():
    print("Inside the function")

my_function()
```

In this example, `decorator_function` is a decorator that wraps around `my_function`. When `my_function` is called, it is actually `wrapper` that gets executed. This allows additional functionality to be added before and after calling `my_function`.

### Follow-up questions:

- **What are some common use cases for applying Decorators in Python?**
  - Logging: Decorators can be used to log function calls, arguments, and return values.
  - Authorization: Decorators can check if a user is authorized to call a certain function.
  - Timing: Decorators can be used to measure the execution time of a function.
  - Caching: Decorators can cache the results of expensive function calls for performance optimization.
  
- **Can Decorators be nested in Python to apply multiple layers of modification to a function?**
  - Yes, decorators can be nested in Python. This allows multiple decorators to be applied to a single function, each adding a different layer of functionality.
  
```python
def decorator1(func):
    def wrapper():
        print("Decorator 1")
        func()
    return wrapper

def decorator2(func):
    def wrapper():
        print("Decorator 2")
        func()
    return wrapper

@decorator1
@decorator2
def my_function():
    print("Inside the function")

my_function()
```

In this example, `my_function` is being wrapped by both `decorator1` and `decorator2`, with `decorator1` being the outermost layer.

- **How do Decorators enhance code reusability and maintainability in Python applications?**
  - Decorators promote the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle by allowing common functionalities to be implemented once and applied to multiple functions.
  - They separate concerns by keeping the core logic of a function separate from additional functionalities added by decorators.
  - Decorators make the code more readable and organized by encapsulating cross-cutting concerns in a modular way.

# Question
**Main question**: What is the syntax for creating a Decorator in Python?

**Explanation**: Illustrate the syntax and structure to define and use a Decorator to decorate a function or method in Python.

**Follow-up questions**:

1. Are Decorators in Python only limited to functions, or can they also be applied to methods of classes?

2. How can you pass arguments to a Decorator function to customize its behavior based on input parameters?

3. Can you explain the difference between using a Decorator and explicitly modifying a function's behavior within its code?





# Answer
### Syntax for Creating a Decorator in Python

In Python, a decorator is defined using the `@decorator_name` syntax followed by the function or method you want to decorate. The basic structure of creating a decorator involves defining a wrapper function that modifies the behavior of the original function. Here is the general syntax for creating a decorator in Python:

```python
def decorator_name(original_function):
    def wrapper_function(*args, **kwargs):
        # Code to be executed before the original function
        result = original_function(*args, **kwargs)
        # Code to be executed after the original function
        return result
    return wrapper_function

@decorator_name
def my_function():
    # Function logic
    pass
```

In the above syntax:
- `decorator_name` refers to the decorator function that will modify the behavior of `my_function`.
- `wrapper_function` is the inner function that contains the modifications and calls the original function.
- `*args` and `**kwargs` allow the decorator to accept any number of positional and keyword arguments.

### Follow-up Questions

1. **Are Decorators in Python only limited to functions, or can they also be applied to methods of classes?**
   
   Decorators in Python can be applied not only to functions but also to methods of classes. When decorating a class method, the decorator function takes an additional `self` parameter to reference the instance of the class.

2. **How can you pass arguments to a Decorator function to customize its behavior based on input parameters?**

   To pass arguments to a decorator, you can define a higher-order function that takes the arguments and returns the actual decorator function. Here is an example:

   ```python
   def custom_decorator(arg1, arg2):
       def decorator_name(original_function):
           def wrapper_function(*args, **kwargs):
               # Custom logic using arg1 and arg2
               result = original_function(*args, **kwargs)
               return result
           return wrapper_function
       return decorator_name

   @custom_decorator('argument1', 'argument2')
   def my_function():
       # Function logic
       pass
   ```

3. **Can you explain the difference between using a Decorator and explicitly modifying a function's behavior within its code?**

   - Using a Decorator:
     - Provides a clean and modular way to add functionality to functions or methods.
     - Promotes code reusability by separating the concern of additional functionality.
     - Allows for easy application of the same behavior across multiple functions.

   - Explicitly Modifying Function's Behavior:
     - Requires modifying the original function directly, which can lead to code duplication and reduced readability.
     - Makes it harder to maintain and update the code as the modification logic is scattered within the function.
     - Does not follow the principle of separation of concerns compared to decorators.

Decorators offer a flexible and efficient way to extend the behavior of functions or methods in Python while keeping the code clean and maintainable.

3. **Enhanced Readability**: Decorators provide a clean and concise way to modify the behavior of functions without cluttering the core implementation. This leads to improved code readability and maintainability.

4. **Dynamic Behavior**: Decorators allow you to dynamically modify the behavior of functions at runtime based on certain conditions or requirements. This flexibility enhances the overall functionality of the code.

5. **Promotes Modularity**: Using decorators encourages a modular design approach where different aspects of a program are isolated into separate decorators. This modularity enhances the overall design and structure of the code.

6. **Encourages Clean Code**: Decorators promote the Single Responsibility Principle by allowing you to separate different concerns into individual decorators, resulting in cleaner and more maintainable code.

7. **Facilitates Testing**: Decorators make it easier to test different aspects of a function or method independently by applying specific decorators during testing scenarios. This improves the testability of the codebase.

### Follow-up Questions

- **How can Decorators help in implementing cross-cutting concerns like logging, caching, or authentication in Python applications?**

Decorators can be used to implement cross-cutting concerns by wrapping the core logic of a function with additional functionality. For example, a logging decorator can log information before and after the execution of a function, a caching decorator can cache the results of function calls, and an authentication decorator can verify user credentials before allowing access to a function.

- **In what ways do Decorators contribute to improving the flexibility and extensibility of functions or methods in Python?**

Decorators enhance the flexibility and extensibility of functions by allowing you to add or modify behavior without changing the original function. This enables you to extend the functionality of a function without altering its core implementation, making it easier to adapt to changing requirements or add new features.

- **Are there any performance implications of using Decorators in Python applications that developers should be aware of?**

While decorators provide numerous benefits, they can also introduce a slight overhead in terms of performance due to the additional function call overhead incurred by the decorator wrapper. Developers should be mindful of this when using decorators in performance-critical sections of the codebase. However, in most applications, the impact on performance is negligible compared to the benefits gained from using decorators.

# Question
**Main question**: How can Decorators be used to measure the execution time of functions in Python?

**Explanation**: Demonstrate how Decorators can be applied to calculate and log the runtime of specific functions to monitor performance.

**Follow-up questions**:

1. What are the potential challenges or considerations when using Decorators for profiling functions in Python?

2. Can Decorators be customized to track additional metrics such as memory usage or disk I/O operations in function execution?

3. How do Decorators aid in identifying bottlenecks or optimizing the performance of critical functions within a Python codebase?





# Answer
### How can Decorators be used to measure the execution time of functions in Python?

Decorators in Python provide a way to modify the behavior of functions without changing their code. One common use case of decorators is to measure the execution time of specific functions for performance monitoring.

Here is an example of how decorators can be utilized to calculate and log the runtime of functions:

```python
import time

def calculate_time(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        end_time = time.time()
        print(f"Execution time of {func.__name__}: {end_time - start_time} seconds")
        return result
    return wrapper

@calculate_time
def example_function():
    # Code implementation of the function
    time.sleep(2)

example_function()
```

In this example, the `calculate_time` decorator is defined to wrap around the target function. It records the start time before calling the function and the end time after the function execution.

The `@calculate_time` syntax is used to apply the decorator to the `example_function`. When `example_function` is called, the decorator calculates and prints the execution time.

### Potential challenges or considerations when using Decorators for profiling functions in Python:
- Overhead: Adding decorators to functions can introduce overhead, impacting the overall performance especially for high-frequency functions.
- Debugging: Decorators can sometimes make debugging more challenging as the function behavior is modified.
- Decorator chaining: The order in which decorators are applied can affect the behavior, so it is important to consider the sequence carefully.

### Can Decorators be customized to track additional metrics such as memory usage or disk I/O operations in function execution?
Yes, decorators can be customized to track additional metrics beyond just execution time. You can create custom decorators to monitor metrics like memory usage, disk I/O operations, or any other performance-related metrics.

Here is an example of a decorator that tracks memory usage in Python:

```python
import psutil

def track_memory(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        # Get current memory usage
        mem_before = psutil.virtual_memory().used
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        mem_after = psutil.virtual_memory().used
        print(f"Memory used by {func.__name__}: {mem_after - mem_before} bytes")
        return result
    return wrapper

@track_memory
def example_function():
    # Code implementation of the function

example_function()
```

### How do Decorators aid in identifying bottlenecks or optimizing the performance of critical functions within a Python codebase?
Decorators play a crucial role in identifying bottlenecks and optimizing performance in Python codebases by:
- Providing a non-intrusive way to add monitoring or optimization logic to functions.
- Enabling developers to collect key performance metrics without modifying the original function code.
- Allowing for targeted optimization efforts on critical functions based on the insights gathered from decorators.
- Facilitating a modular and reusable approach to performance profiling and optimization by encapsulating monitoring logic within decorators.
