        - **Print Statements**: Inserted print statements within the function to track values and verify computations.
        - **Visualizations**: Used matplotlib to plot intermediate results and identify anomalies.
        - **Debugger**: Stepped through the function using a debugger to inspect variables at each step.
    5. **Successful Resolution**: Discovered a subtle error in the mathematical formula used and corrected it. After fixing the function, retested with various inputs to ensure the issue was entirely resolved.

This experience highlighted the importance of meticulous debugging, leveraging different techniques, and persisting through an iterative process to conquer challenging bugs effectively. 

By following a systematic approach, employing various debugging tools, and maintaining documentation and version control, developers can efficiently debug Python code, tackle runtime errors, and resolve unexpected behaviors, ensuring robust and reliable software.
