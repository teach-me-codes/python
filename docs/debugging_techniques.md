- **Debug Logging**: Use print statements with descriptive messages to create a log of the program's execution, aiding in post-mortem analysis if issues arise.

#### Example Code Snippet:
```python
def divide_numbers(a, b):
    print(f"Dividing {a} by {b}")
    try:
        result = a / b
        print(f"Result of division: {result}")
    except ZeroDivisionError as e:
        print("Error: division by zero!")
    return result
```

### Follow-up Questions:

#### Best Practices for Placing Print Statements in Code:
- **Strategic Placement**: Insert print statements before and after critical operations, loops, or conditionals to track the program's state.
- **Use of Headers**: Add clear headers to print statements to distinguish different sections or functions in the output.
- **Temporarily Comment Out**: When debugged, remove or comment print statements to maintain clean code.

#### Employing the Logging Module as an Alternative:
- **Module Initialization**:
  - Import the logging module: `import logging`.
  - Configure the logging settings: `logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)`.
- **Usage**:
  - Replace print statements with `logging.debug()`, `logging.info()`, etc.
  - Enable logging to files, streams, etc., for better log management.

#### Demonstrating Bug Identification with Print Statements:
Consider a scenario where a function to calculate the factorial of a number has a bug:
```python
def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result

# Bug: The loop runs from 1 to n (inclusive) instead of up to n.
number = 5
print(factorial(number))
```
Output:
```
15
```
Issue:
- By inserting a print statement inside the loop `print(i, result)`, the wrong output helps identify the bug where the loop exceeds the correct range.

Using print statements strategically and thoughtfully can significantly aid in debugging Python code, providing visibility into program behavior at different levels of execution.
