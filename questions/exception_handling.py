{'Main question': 'What is Exception Handling in Python programming?', 'Explanation': 'The interviewee should explain the concept of Exception Handling as a mechanism to deal with errors and exceptional situations that occur during program execution, preventing the program from crashing.', 'Follow-up questions': ['How does Exception Handling improve the robustness and reliability of Python programs?', 'Can you provide an example of when Exception Handling would be beneficial in a Python script?', 'What are the key components of an exception block in Python code?']}, 
{'Main question': 'How are exceptions raised and caught in Python?', 'Explanation': 'The candidate should describe the process of raising exceptions using the raise keyword and catching exceptions using try-except blocks in Python to handle errors gracefully.', 'Follow-up questions': ['What happens when an exception is raised in Python code without any corresponding catch block?', 'Can you explain the difference between using a broad except block versus specific except blocks for different types of exceptions?', 'How can multiple except blocks be structured to handle different types of exceptions in a Python program?']}, 
{'Main question': 'What is the purpose of the finally block in Python Exception Handling?', 'Explanation': 'The candidate should explain the role of the finally block in Python Exception Handling, which allows for the execution of cleanup code regardless of whether an exception is raised or not.', 'Follow-up questions': ['How does the finally block contribute to resource management and cleanup tasks in Python programs?', 'In what scenarios would you use the finally block in conjunction with the try-except blocks?', 'Can you provide an example where the finally block would be essential for ensuring proper program execution in Python?']}, 
{'Main question': 'How can custom exceptions be defined and raised in Python?', 'Explanation': 'The interviewee should discuss the process of creating custom exception classes by inheriting from the base Exception class in Python and raising instances of these custom exceptions to handle specific error scenarios.', 'Follow-up questions': ['What are the advantages of using custom exceptions over built-in exceptions in Python programs?', 'How can custom exceptions help in providing more descriptive error messages to developers and users?', 'Can you illustrate a scenario where defining and raising a custom exception would be particularly useful in a Python project?']}, 
{'Main question': 'What are some best practices for handling exceptions in Python?', 'Explanation': 'The candidate should mention best practices like being specific in exception handling, avoiding broad except blocks, logging exceptions for debugging purposes, and handling exceptions at an appropriate level in the program.', 'Follow-up questions': ['How can the use of logging in exception handling assist in troubleshooting and diagnosing issues in Python programs?', 'What strategies can be employed to prevent silent failures and ensure proper error reporting in Python code?', 'In what ways can structured exception handling improve the overall quality and maintainability of Python programs?']}
