    {'Main question': 'What is a Metaclass in Python?', 'Explanation': 'A Metaclass in Python is a class used to create classes. It defines the behavior of classes by customizing class creation and modifying class attributes and methods.', 'Follow-up questions': ['How is a Metaclass different from a regular class in Python?', 'Can you provide an example of when you would need to use a Metaclass in your Python code?', 'What are some practical applications of using Metaclasses in Python programming?']},
    {'Main question': 'How do you define a Metaclass in Python?', 'Explanation': 'In Python, you can define a Metaclass by creating a class that inherits from type. This allows you to customize the behavior of classes created from that Metaclass.', 'Follow-up questions': ['What are some common methods or attributes that can be defined in a Metaclass?', 'How does the __metaclass__ attribute or metaclass parameter in class declarations relate to defining a Metaclass?', 'Can you explain the role of Metaclasses in enforcing class level restrictions or validations in Python programs?']},
    {'Main question': 'What are the benefits of using Metaclasses in Python?', 'Explanation': 'Using Metaclasses in Python allows for advanced customization and control over class creation. It enables you to enforce design patterns, apply common behavior across classes, and perform metaprogramming tasks dynamically.', 'Follow-up questions': ['How can Metaclasses help in implementing singleton patterns or factories in Python?', 'In what scenarios would you choose to use a Metaclass over other forms of class customization such as decorators or inheritance?', 'Can you discuss any potential drawbacks or caveats when using Metaclasses in Python programming?']},
    {'Main question': 'How does inheritance work with Metaclasses in Python?', 'Explanation': 'In Python, Metaclasses can be inherited just like regular classes. This means that subclasses can inherit the behavior defined in the Metaclass, allowing for consistent customization across multiple classes.', 'Follow-up questions': ['What happens when a subclass defines its own Metaclass in Python?', 'How can multiple inheritance impact the behavior of classes created using Metaclasses?', 'Can you explain the concept of method resolution order (MRO) and its interaction with classes defined using Metaclasses?']},
    {'Main question': 'Can you provide an example of using a Metaclass to create a custom class in Python?', 'Explanation': 'The candidate should demonstrate creating a custom Metaclass and using it to define a class with specific behaviors or attributes. This example should showcase the practical application and flexibility of using Metaclasses in Python.', 'Follow-up questions': ['What challenges or considerations did you encounter while implementing the custom Metaclass?', 'How does the custom Metaclass enhance or extend the functionality of the class beyond standard Python features?', 'In what ways can the custom Metaclass simplify or streamline the development process of complex applications?']}
