questions = [{'Main question': 'What is Inheritance in the context of object-oriented programming?', 'Explanation': 'Explain how inheritance allows you to create new classes based on existing classes, inheriting their attributes and methods. Discuss how this promotes code reuse and facilitates the creation of specialized classes.', 'Follow-up questions': ['Can you provide an example of inheritance in Python and how it helps in structuring code efficiently?', 'How does inheritance relate to the concept of parent and child classes in object-oriented programming?', 'What are the benefits of using inheritance in terms of reducing code duplication and improving maintainability?']}, {'Main question': 'How does Polymorphism enhance flexibility in object-oriented programming?', 'Explanation': 'Describe how polymorphism enables objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass, allowing for more versatile and dynamic code implementation. Highlight how polymorphism promotes code extensibility and interchangeability.', 'Follow-up questions': ['What are the key principles that underlie polymorphism in Python and its role in achieving abstraction?', 'Can you explain the concept of method overriding and method overloading in the context of polymorphism?', 'How does polymorphism contribute to achieving a more modular and scalable codebase in complex software systems?']}, {'Main question': 'What are the main differences between inheritance and polymorphism in object-oriented programming?', 'Explanation': 'Provide a comparison of how inheritance focuses on reusability and relationship between classes, while polymorphism emphasizes flexibility and multiple forms of behavior. Discuss how these concepts complement each other    in building robust and adaptable code structures.', 'Follow-up questions': ['How can inheritance and polymorphism be used together to design complex systems with varying behaviors and functionalities?', 'In what scenarios would you prioritize using inheritance over polymorphism or vice versa for better code design?', 'Can you elaborate on any potential challenges or pitfalls that developers may encounter when implementing inheritance and polymorphism in Python?']}, {'Main question': 'How can inheritance help in creating specialized classes with additional features?', 'Explanation': 'Explain how inheritance allows for the creation of subclasses that inherit attributes and methods from a parent class while also having the flexibility to add new features or functionalities. Discuss the concept of class extension and customization through inheritance in Python.', 'Follow-up questions': ['What are the implications of modifying inherited methods or attributes in a subclass on the overall code structure?', 'Can you describe a real-world example where inheritance is used effectively to build a hierarchy of related classes with distinct functionalities?', 'How does inheritance promote scalability and adaptability in software development by allowing for easy modifications and extensions?']}, {'Main question': 'How does polymorphism enable more dynamic and versatile coding practices in Python?', 'Explanation': 'Discuss how polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated uniformly through a common interface, leading to increased code flexibility and adaptability to changing requirements. Explore how polymorphism simplifies code maintenance and supports future enhancements.', 'Follow-up questions': ['How can the use of polymorphism lead to cleaner and more concise code implementations compared to static type systems?', 'Can you provide an example where polymorphism enhances the readability and clarity of code by abstracting away specific class implementations?', 'In what ways does polymorphism contribute to the design principle of encapsulation and separation of concerns in object-oriented programming?']}]
