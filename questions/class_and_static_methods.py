    {'Main question': 'What is a class method in Python and how does it differ from an instance method?', 'Explanation': 'Explain how class methods are defined with the @classmethod decorator, operate on the class itself rather than instances, and can be used to modify class variables or perform operations that are not specific to any instance.', 'Follow-up questions': ['What are some common use cases for class methods in Python programming?', 'How can class methods be utilized to create alternative constructors for a class?', 'Can you discuss the concept of method resolution order (MRO) in the context of class methods?']},
    {'Main question': 'How do you define a static method in a Python class and when is it typically used?', 'Explanation': 'Describe the @staticmethod decorator used to define static methods in Python, which do not have access to class or instance attributes but are useful for grouping utility functions or operations that do not require instance or class-specific data.', 'Follow-up questions': ['In what scenarios would using a static method be more appropriate than a class method or instance method?', 'Can you provide examples of situations where static methods are commonly employed in Python code?', 'How does the absence of self or cls parameters in static methods impact their behavior and usage within a class?']},
    {'Main question': 'What are the benefits of using class methods and static methods in Python programming?', 'Explanation': 'Discuss the advantages of encapsulating shared functionality within class methods and static methods, including improved code organization, easier maintenance, and efficient access to common operations without the need for instance attributes.', 'Follow-up questions': ['How can the use of class methods and static methods enhance code reusability and promote modular design in Python programs?', 'In what ways do class methods and static methods contribute to better performance and resource management in large-scale Python applications?', 'Can you explain how class methods and static methods facilitate better testing practices and debugging processes during software development?']},
    {'Main question': 'How are class methods and static methods different from regular instance methods in Python?', 'Explanation': 'Elaborate on the distinctions between class methods, which operate on the class itself with access to class variables, and static methods, which are independent of class and instance attributes, compared to instance methods that interact with specific instances and their attributes.', 'Follow-up questions': ['What are the key considerations when deciding whether to use a class method, a static method, or an instance method for a particular functionality?', 'Can you illustrate a scenario where converting an instance method to a class method or a static method would improve code clarity and efficiency?', 'How does the choice of method type impact the design and maintainability of a Python class or object-oriented system?']},
    {'Main question': 'How can class methods and static methods contribute to the design and implementation of a Python application?', 'Explanation': 'Explain how the use of class methods and static methods can promote a cleaner and more organized code structure, facilitate shared functionality across multiple instances, and enhance the versatility and extensibility of Python applications by encapsulating logic that is agnostic to specific instances or class state.', 'Follow-up questions': ['What strategies can be employed to effectively document and communicate the purpose and usage of class methods and static methods within a Python codebase?', 'In what ways do class methods and static methods align with the principles of object-oriented programming and modular design in Python development?', 'Can you provide examples of design patterns or best practices where the implementation of class methods and static methods is particularly beneficial for software scalability and maintainability?']}
