        'Main question': 'What is the purpose of Control Flow Statements in Basic Python?',
        'Explanation': 'The candidate should explain how Control Flow Statements allow for the execution of code based on conditions, such as using `if` and `else` statements for conditional execution and `for` and `while` loops for iteration.',

        'Main question': 'What is the difference between an `if` statement and a `while` loop in Python?',
        'Explanation': 'The candidate should differentiate between `if` statements, which execute code based on a specific condition, and `while` loops, which repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a condition is true.',
        'Follow-up questions': ['How can you break out of a `while` loop in Python?', 'What criteria should be considered when choosing between an `if` statement and a `while` loop for a particular programming task?', 'Can you explain the concept of an infinite loop and how it may arise when using `while` loops?']

        'Main question': 'How is the `else` statement used in conjunction with an `if` statement in Python?',
        'Explanation': 'The candidate should describe the role of the `else` statement as providing an alternative action when the condition specified in the preceding `if` statement is not met.',
        'Follow-up questions': ['What is the significance of the `else` statement in controlling the flow of execution in Python programs?', 'Can you illustrate a scenario where using an `if-else` statement combination is more appropriate than using multiple `if` statements?', 'How does nesting `if-else` statements allow for more complex decision-making processes in Python programs?']

        'Main question': 'How does a `for` loop differ from a `while` loop in Python?',
        'Explanation': 'The candidate should explain the distinction between `for` loops, which iterate over a sequence of elements until the sequence is exhausted, and `while` loops, which repeat a block of code as long as a specific condition remains true.',
        'Follow-up questions': ['In what situations is a `for` loop generally preferred over a `while` loop, and vice versa?', 'What are the benefits of using a `for` loop when working with collections like lists, tuples, or dictionaries in Python?', 'Can you provide an example of a nested `for` loop and its practical utility in solving programming tasks?']

        'Explanation': 'The candidate should demonstrate the application of `if` and `else` statements to create branching logic that adapts program behavior based on varying conditions or inputs.',
        'Follow-up questions': ['What role does the logical test specified in an `if` statement play in determining which code block is executed?', 'How can the use of logical operators such as `and`, `or`, and `not` enhance the decision-making capability within Control Flow Statements?', 'Can you discuss any best practices for structuring and organizing Control Flow Statements to ensure code readability and maintainability?']
