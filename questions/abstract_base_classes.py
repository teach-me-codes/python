    {'Main question': 'What are Abstract Base Classes in Python, and how do they enforce method implementations in subclasses?', 'Explanation': 'Abstract Base Classes are classes that define a set of methods that must be implemented by subclasses, serving as interfaces to enforce method implementations in derived classes.', 'Follow-up questions': ['How are Abstract Base Classes different from regular classes in Python?', 'Can you provide an example of a scenario where Abstract Base Classes would be useful in a Python project?', 'What is the significance of using Abstract Base Classes for code readability and maintainability?']},
    {'Main question': 'How can you create an Abstract Base Class in Python, and what is the purpose of using the abc module?', 'Explanation': 'The candidate should explain the process of defining an Abstract Base Class using the abc module in Python, emphasizing the importance of abstraction and providing a clear structure for subclasses.', 'Follow-up questions': ['What are the key features of the abc module that facilitate the creation and utilization of Abstract Base Classes?', 'How does defining Abstract Base Classes help in achieving polymorphism and code reusability in Python?', 'Can you explain the concept of abstract methods and properties in the context of Abstract Base Classes?']},
    {'Main question': 'What is the role of Abstract Methods and Abstract Properties within an Abstract Base Class?', 'Explanation': 'Abstract Methods and Abstract Properties defined within an Abstract Base Class act as placeholders for methods and properties that must be implemented by subclasses, ensuring a consistent interface across different implementations.', 'Follow-up questions': ['How do Abstract Methods contribute to the concept of polymorphism and dynamic dispatch in Python?', 'Can you provide examples of situations where Abstract Properties would be more suitable than regular class properties?', 'In what ways do Abstract Methods and Properties enhance code modularity and extensibility in object-oriented programming?']},
    {'Main question': 'How do subclasses inherit and implement methods from an Abstract Base Class in Python?', 'Explanation': 'Subclasses inherit the abstract methods and properties defined in an Abstract Base Class, which they must implement to provide concrete functionality. The candidate should explain the process of subclassing an Abstract Base Class and fulfilling the abstract requirements.', 'Follow-up questions': ['What happens if a subclass fails to implement all the abstract methods or properties defined by the Abstract Base Class?', 'Can subclasses of an Abstract Base Class also define additional methods beyond the abstract ones?', 'How does the practice of method overriding in subclasses contribute to code flexibility and customization in Python?']},
    {'Main question': 'How do Abstract Base Classes promote code consistency and standardization in Python projects?', 'Explanation': 'Abstract Base Classes establish a clear structure and set of guidelines for subclasses to follow, promoting uniformity in method implementations and ensuring adherence to a common interface across different class implementations.', 'Follow-up questions': ['What are the advantages of using Abstract Base Classes for large codebases with multiple developers working on the same project?', 'How can Abstract Base Classes help in reducing errors and inconsistencies in method implementations across different subclasses?', 'In what ways do Abstract Base Classes facilitate code maintenance and future modifications in software development projects?']}
