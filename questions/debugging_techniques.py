    {
        'Main question': 'How can you effectively use print statements for debugging Python code?',
        'Explanation': 'The interviewee should explain the use of print statements as a fundamental debugging technique in Python to output variable values, control flow, and program state at different stages of execution for error identification and troubleshooting.',
        'Follow-up questions': ['What are the best practices for strategically placing print statements in code for efficient debugging?', 'How can the logging module be employed as an alternative to print statements for debugging?', 'Can you demonstrate a scenario where print statements helped in identifying and resolving a bug in Python code?']

    {
        'Main question': 'What is the Python debugger (pdb) and how can it be utilized for debugging?',
        'Explanation': 'The interviewee should describe the Python debugger (pdb) as a built-in interactive debugging tool in Python that allows users to set breakpoints, inspect variables, control program execution, and navigate through the code for debugging purposes.',
        'Follow-up questions': ['How do you set breakpoints and step through code using the Python debugger (pdb)?', 'What are some useful commands available in the pdb debugger for analyzing and debugging Python code?', 'Can you explain the difference between pdb\'s line-by-line execution and setting conditional breakpoints for debugging?']

    {
        'Main question': 'How can you debug Python code that is not behaving as expected?',
        'Explanation': 'The interviewee should discuss systematic approaches to debugging unexpected behavior in Python code, starting from understanding the problem, isolating the issue, testing hypotheses, and iteratively applying debugging techniques to identify and resolve the root cause of the problem.',
        'Follow-up questions': ['What strategies can be used to debug code that produces runtime errors or exceptions in Python?', 'How important is maintaining documentation and version control in the debugging process?', 'Can you share a challenging debugging experience you encountered and how you successfully resolved it?']
