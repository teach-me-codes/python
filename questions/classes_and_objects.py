        'Main question': 'How are objects instantiated from a class in Python?',
        'Explanation': 'Discuss the process of creating instances of a class to generate objects with specific attributes and methods. Explain the role of the constructor method and how it initializes object properties.',
        'Follow-up questions': ['What is the difference between a class attribute and an instance attribute in Python?', 'Can you elaborate on the concept of inheritance and how it is implemented in Python classes?', 'How can encapsulation be achieved in Python classes to ensure data security and integrity?']

        'Main question': 'What are methods in Python classes and how do they contribute to the behavior of objects?',
        'Explanation': 'Define methods within a class as functions that operate on objects and explain how they define the behavior and actions of objects. Discuss the difference between instance methods, class methods, and static methods in Python.',

        'Main question': 'How can inheritance be utilized in Python classes to create hierarchical relationships between objects?',
        'Explanation': 'Describe how inheritance allows the creation of new classes based on existing classes, inheriting their attributes and methods. Explain the concepts of parent classes (superclasses) and child classes (subclasses) in Python.',

        'Main question': 'What is the significance of encapsulation in Python classes and how does it promote data hiding and abstraction?',
        'Explanation': 'Elaborate on how encapsulation allows bundling of data with methods to restrict access and prevent direct modification. Discuss the importance of data protection and abstraction in object-oriented programming using encapsulation.',
        'Follow-up questions': ['How can you achieve data hiding in Python classes to ensure data privacy and integrity?', 'What are the benefits of using property decorators in Python for encapsulating class attributes?', 'Can you explain how encapsulation enhances code maintainability and reusability in object-oriented design?']
