    {'Main question': 'What are Type Conversion Functions in Python and why are they important?', 'Explanation': 'The candidate should explain the purpose of Type Conversion Functions in Python, which allow for converting data between different data types like integers, floats, strings, and lists, and how they are crucial for data processing and manipulation.', 'Follow-up questions': ['How does the ability to convert data types enhance the flexibility and usability of Python programs?', 'Can you provide examples of scenarios where type conversion functions would be necessary in data analysis or manipulation tasks?', 'What challenges or errors can arise when data types are not properly converted in Python programs?']},
    {'Main question': 'How can you convert a string to an integer in Python using Type Conversion Functions?', 'Explanation': 'The candidate should describe the process of converting a string representing a numerical value into an integer using functions like int() and explain any considerations or potential errors that may arise during the conversion.', 'Follow-up questions': ['What happens if the string being converted to an integer contains non-numeric characters?', 'Can you discuss the implications of losing data precision when converting floating-point numbers to integers?', 'How would you handle exceptions or errors that could occur during the string to integer conversion process?']},
    {'Main question': 'What is the difference between implicit and explicit type conversion in Python?', 'Explanation': 'The candidate should differentiate between implicit type conversion, where data type conversion occurs automatically by Python, and explicit type conversion, where the programmer explicitly converts data types using built-in functions like int(), float(), str(), etc.', 'Follow-up questions': ['How does Python determine when to perform implicit type conversion during operations involving different data types?', 'In what situations would you prefer explicit type conversion over implicit conversion for better control and clarity in your code?', 'Can you provide examples where implicit type conversion can lead to unexpected results or errors in Python programs?']},
    {'Main question': 'How can you convert a floating-point number to a string in Python?', 'Explanation': 'The candidate should explain the process of converting a float data type to a string using functions like str() and discuss any potential formatting or precision considerations that need to be taken into account during the conversion.', 'Follow-up questions': ['What formatting options are available when converting floats to strings in Python?', 'How would you handle rounding or truncation issues that may arise when converting floating-point numbers to strings?', 'Can you discuss any performance implications of converting numeric data types to strings in terms of memory usage or processing speed?']},
    {'Main question': 'Why is it important to understand and utilize type conversion functions effectively in Python programming?', 'Explanation': 'The candidate should emphasize the significance of proper type conversion in ensuring data integrity, avoiding errors, and enabling efficient data processing and manipulation tasks in Python programs.', 'Follow-up questions': ['How can improper handling of data types lead to unexpected behaviors or bugs in Python applications?', 'What strategies or best practices would you recommend for optimizing the use of type conversion functions in Python code?', 'In what ways do type conversion functions contribute to writing more robust and reliable Python programs?']}
