        'Main question': 'What is profiling and optimization in Python?',
        'Explanation': 'The candidate should define profiling as the process of measuring a program\'s performance to identify bottlenecks and optimization as the act of improving code efficiency. In Python, this involves using tools and libraries to analyze code execution and enhance its speed and resource usage.',
        'Follow-up questions': ['How can profiling help in identifying performance bottlenecks in Python code?', 'What are some common optimization techniques used in Python programming?', 'Can you explain the difference between time complexity and space complexity in the context of code optimization?']
    },
    {
        'Main question': 'What are some built-in tools in Python for profiling code?',
        'Explanation': 'The candidate should discuss Python\'s standard libraries like cProfile and timeit, which offer capabilities for profiling code execution time, function calls, and overall performance metrics.',
        'Follow-up questions': ['How does cProfile differ from the timeit module in profiling Python code?', 'Can you explain how decorators can be used for profiling specific functions in Python programs?', 'What information do tools like pstats provide when analyzing profiling results in Python?']
